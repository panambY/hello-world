I was a marine officer of the Brazilian navy for 13 years and when I arrived at the post of Captain I gave up everything with the purpose of doing what I love. My dream is to work in the programming area. I made my first step when I go to Canada at the beginning of this year to take an English course for 4 months at Algonquin College with the purpose of later joining the same institution to take an IT course. 

I had to go back to Brazil to take care of my father with cancer and now, that the situation has normalized, I'm going to Ireland to improve my English skill and after do a coding Bootcamp in data Science.

Meanwhile I'm learning Python, Data Science and Machine Learning through Education Online Platforms.

I am dedicated, disciplined, determined and willing to learn anything. Military life reinforced all my characteristics and taught me many others.

As someone who has left a reality of poverty in my family and reached the post of Captain I know that only with sacrifice and dedication can we achieve our goals in life.
